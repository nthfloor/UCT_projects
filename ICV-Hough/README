README - ICV Hough Transform

This project has been done in java which means it should function on all platforms as long Java is installed.
I have included a makefile with which you can compile and run the code as follows:

	- make 
	- make run

	or alternatively:
	- make crun(a combination of the above commands)

For convenience I have included a jar file with the project. Remember to make the jar file executable before running it. Otherwise jun it from the command line with the following command:
	
	- java -jar {filename}.jar
	- Or if you prefer using a makefile
		- make run_jar

I have only tested this on Ubuntu. So if it does not work, you will need to use the makefile. 

INSTRUCTIONS:

You need to load an image into the program. A dialog will appear to assist you. I have provided the first image from the samples. You then need to select what radius boundries you want and what number of circles you want the algorithm to use. 

3 images will be displayed. The original, the accumulated values and the original again, but this time with the shape's outline highlighted over the original. 
You need to press the 'Process' button to start the analysis process. 

Just to NOTE that the range slider I used was not my code, I got it off https://github.com/ernieyu/Swing-range-slider. Which I used for the radius double-ended slider.
