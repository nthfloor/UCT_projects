Projects done while studying at University of Cape Town
=======================================================

This programs are mostly written in Java with the exception of my honours project, which was written in python.
While I had to do many more projects than these. They were not as functional nor interesting in terms of the problem being solved.

These projects come from all 4 years of my time of study at UCT, which will be indicated in the relevent READMEs. So when reviewing the code, bear in mind that some of it was writen almost 4 years ago...in my youth.
